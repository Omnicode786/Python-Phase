#  using singel breackets give us a series and double brackets gives a dataframe
#  this is meta data A Series is like a single column of data, while a DataFrame is a table with multiple columns. Letâ€™s break it down.
# A Series is a one-dimensional array that holds a single column of data.


#  we can also do indexing to access colunms and rows
print(dataframeoffriends.iloc[0][0])
#  we can also do it like this

print(dataframeoffriends.loc[1,"BestFriends"])

# A DataFrame is a two-dimensional, size-mutable, and potentially heterogeneous tabular data structure with labeled axes (rows and columns).

#  we can also find uniqeness of a dataframe

df1 = df[df["Year"]>2017]
#  in this way we can get only the certain data which are of 2017 year and above similarly we can do alot

print(10>1)
print("cat" == "dog")
# basically this can vbe done with all we cann ot > < or with int, float to string

# print (1 > "1")
#the above will give error

print (1 =="1")
# this will basically see the data type if the data type of the them folllwing are same then true and in this case false
# // logical operator
print(25>40 or 1 != 2)
# the not operator basically how not works in discrete structure
# not operator makes it so that if a certain condition is true it makes it false and viceversa
print(not 60>70)
#the above now becomes true

if 60>40:
    print("60 is greater than 40")
